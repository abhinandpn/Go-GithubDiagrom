# Viper-Golang

```
Golang viper is a package that helps to provide full configuration to an application 
in Golang with 12-factor apps. Handling and updating configuration for a large 
and complex program, such as creating a server application or any other application 
that relies heavily on user configuration manipulation, is a difficult undertaking. 
Furthermore, current programs are designed to run in a variety of settings, 
such as Docker, cloud infrastructures, and so forth.
